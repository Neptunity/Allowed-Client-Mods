Punishment info:

Recommended clients - Anything mentioned under the "Recommended clients section". There is a low chance of getting punished if using any of these clients, but it could happen. If it happens, then do not hesitate to open a ticket and we will get to it right away.

Neutral clients - The same as "Recommended clients" except these clients are not recommended because there is nothing special about it, or it only changes things on a certain server, etc.

Use at own risk clients - If using these clients, staff will not ban you, the anti-cheat could. If you open a ticket about an issue that was created with anything other than the "Recommended clients" or the "Neutral clients" it will be immediately archived.

Prohibited clients - If using any of these, you may get punished by the anti-cheat or staff. By using these clients you are ruining the experience for others. We want to provide everyone (this includes you) a great experience on our server. This is why we have a strong policy against these clients.

Note: Anti-cheat bans always last 7 days, staff bans may last longer!

We have the right to change this any time!

These changes first take effect after the caves and cliffs part one (1.17) update on 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝟖, 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟏.
